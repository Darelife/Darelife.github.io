                   Sup, Mr.Random Internet Noob. Well, you might be wondering 
about why this asshole on the internet might even want to create
a blog. Well, I don't know either. I just wanted to try out some
new stuff and I thought that this might be a good idea. That's what 
I would say if I was a normal person. But I am not. I am a person who
is so bored that he is writing a blog. I guess this thing could act 
like a cool motivational source or something, and just a fun way to
make an online journal, or a, "My Coding Journey" kind of thing.
So, yeah that's it. I guess I will be writing more stuff here in the
future. I don't know. I am just a random guy on the internet. I don't
know what I am doing. I am just trying to make this thing look cool.
<br>
I've created a bunch of other websites like, 
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://personal-website.itzp13.repl.co/">My Personal Website</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://flasklastfm.darelife.repl.co/">A website to quickly access info. about the song we are listening to</a></li>
    <li>And ofcourse, i also created this website too</li>
</ol>
