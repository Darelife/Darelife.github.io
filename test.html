      <h2>Microsoft's Activision Blizzard Acquisition Approved by EU Regulators</h2>
      <p>The European Commission has approved Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the maker of popular video game franchises like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.</p>
      <p>The deal, which is worth $68.7 billion, was first announced in January 2022. It is the largest acquisition in the history of the video game industry.</p>
      <p>The European Commission's approval is a major victory for Microsoft. The company had faced concerns from regulators that the deal would give Microsoft too much power in the video game market.</p>
      <p>However, the European Commission said that the deal would not harm competition in the market. The Commission found that Microsoft would not be able to use its market power to raise prices or reduce innovation.</p>
      <p>The approval of the deal is a major step forward for Microsoft. It will give the company a major foothold in the mobile gaming market, where Activision Blizzard is a major player.</p>
      <p>The deal is also a major victory for the video game industry. It is a sign that the industry is maturing and that it is open to consolidation.</p>
